# i1 Heartbeat
-- a port of i2 heartbeat.\
This port is not that good and will DEFINITELY be improved lots after release.\
LDL flavors are "included"- they are not LDL, do not try using them as I have not figured out LDL flavors yet.\
\
Please contribute if you know what you are doing and have things to add.\
I made this basic port the day I got i1 working in order to use it for my stream.\
\
You will have to manually update the IP for the i1 in handlers.js.
